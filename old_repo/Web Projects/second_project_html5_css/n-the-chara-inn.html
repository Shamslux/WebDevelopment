                        <p>
                            Chará was founded in the beautiful island of Santorini, Greece, in 1975 
                            by the lovely couple, Dimitris and Maria Papadopoulos. Dimitris and Maria 
                            had always dreamed of creating a place where couples could come and experience 
                            the beauty and romance of Greece. They wanted to offer a unique experience 
                            that would leave a lasting impression on their guests.

                            When they first opened Chará, it was a small inn with just a few rooms. However, Dimi
