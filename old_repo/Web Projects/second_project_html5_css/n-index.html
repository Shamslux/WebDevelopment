                        Chará is a traditional Greek inn that offers a cozy and romantic atmosphere 
                        for couples looking to escape to one of the most beautiful islands in the world. 
                        Our inn is situated on a hilltop that overlooks the Aegean Sea and offers breathtaking 
                        views of the caldera and the famous Santorini sunset. Chará is a perfect blend of 
                        traditional Greek architecture and modern amenities. Our rooms are beautifully 
                        decorated with traditional Greek furnishings and offer all the modern comforts you 
                        need for a comfortable stay. At Chará, we believe that hospitality is an art, and we 
                        pride ourselves on providing our guests with the best possible service. Whether you're 
                        looking to relax, explore the island, or simply enjoy the stunning views, Chará is the 
                        perfect place for your Santorini getaway.
