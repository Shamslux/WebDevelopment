                        I could say a little about myself by stating that I am a simple Brazilian guy. I am married and have a child whom I
                        adore. My interests include spending time with my family, reading, studying, playing games, learning languages, and
                        pursuing various hobbies.<br>
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        Until 2021, I worked as a Middle and High-School teacher. However, I transitioned to a new role as a Business
                        Intelligence Intern at a Brazilian company called SPIRIT. They are a fan industry and sellers. During my time there, I
                        honed my business analysis skills and contributed to their Business Intelligence project. Unfortunately, the project did
                        not continue, and I completed my internship term before leaving the company.<br>
                    </p>
                        From there, I went to a Brazilian consultancy firm called OWSE as a Business Intelligence Analyst. I initially
                        joined as a Trainee and have progressed within the company. In collaboration with my current team, I have gained
                        experience in various aspects of Business Intelligence, such as business requirements gathering, conducting key user
                        interviews, employing agile methodology, utilizing Git for project version control, implementing CI/CD using Jenkins as
                        our ETL scheduler, performing ETL using SQL, as well as employing tools like Apache HOP and Pentaho PDI. Additionally, I
                        am proficient in intermediate to advanced SQL, possess basic skills in Python programming, PySpark, Docker, and have
                        familiarity with the Hadoop environment and other Big Data and Data Engineering concepts.<br>
                    <p>
                        With this knowledge baggage acquired at OWSE, I was able to continue my professional journey, and today, I work as a
                        Data Engineer at Accenture. I am assigned to a project for a large telecommunications company in Brazil. The project
                        involves the migration of over 10,000 Big Data processes, making it one of the largest Hadoop environment migrations in
                        the world. In this project, I started using the ETL tool called Jiang ETL (JTL), PySpark, Python, Scala, and the
                        PowerCenter Informatica tool. In general, I work on the migration of data pipelines and the adjustments to be made in
                        Shell, Python, and Scala scripts.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, my brother-in-law is studying Web Development, which motivated me to embark on this journey together with him
                        for moral support, haha! I am thoroughly enjoying studying web development during my free time and aspire to take on
                        freelance projects in the future.<br>
                    </p>
