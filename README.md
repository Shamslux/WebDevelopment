This project is a little more robust. It simulates a gardening blog. The links in the main menu of 
the site have a simple animation, as well as the icons that direct to social networks. 
Here I was able to work on some new features such as link formatting, use of "float" and more practical use of CSS.

This simple project features the homepage of a local news website. The links now, in addition to a 
slight animation when hovering the mouse, also have a visible mark to indicate to the user the page 
he is on (in this case, as I only made the home page, there is only this evidence for the single page 
itself , but it would be perfectly expandable if I moved forward with the project).

Some more intermediate resources used were the use of false columns with images, again the use of 
float, in addition to better blending the images used with the background of the site.
